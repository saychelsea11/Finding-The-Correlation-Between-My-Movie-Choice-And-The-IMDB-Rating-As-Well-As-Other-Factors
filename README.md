*Finding-The-Correlation-Between-My-Movie-Choice-And-The-IMDB-Rating-As-Well-As-Other-Factors*

# Goal

- To see if my likes and dislikes with respect to movies match with the IMDB ratings for those movies. 
- If there is a correlation between the two, I can base my movie choices on the IMDB rating to make sure that I mostly watch the movies that I would enjoy. 
- From what I have casually observed, the movies I tend to like do generally have higher IMDB ratings. But this analysis can be used to confirm or disprove that notion.
